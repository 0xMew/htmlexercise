        <b>A brand new substance, which could reduce lithium use in batteries, has been discovered using artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing.</b>
    </p>
    <p>The findings were made by Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which is part of the US Department of Energy.</p>
    <p>Scientists say the material could potentially reduce lithium use by up to 70%.</p>
    <p>Since its discovery the new material has been used to power a lightbulb.</p>
    <p>Microsoft researchers used AI and supercomputers to narrow down 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than a week - a screening process that could have taken more than two decades to carry out using traditional lab research methods.</p>
    <p>The process from inception to the development of a working battery prototype took less than nine months.</p>
    <p>The two organisations achieved this by using advanced AI and high-performance computing which combines large numbers of computers to solve complex scientific and mathematical tasks.</p>
    <p>Executive vice president of Microsoft, Jason Zander, told the BBC one of the tech giant's missions was to <i>"compress 250 years of scientific discovery into the next 25"</i>.</p>
    <p><i>"And we think technology like this will help us do that. This is the way that this type of science I think is going to get done in the future,"</i> he said.</p>

    <h2>The problem with lithium</h2>
    <p>Lithium is often referred to as <i>"white gold"</i> because of its market value and silvery color. It is one of the key components in rechargeable batteries (lithium-ion batteries) that power everything from electric vehicles (EVs) to smartphones.</p>
    <p>As the need for the metal ramps up and the demand for EVs rises, the world could face a shortage of the material as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
    <p>It is also expected that demand for lithium-ion batteries will increase up to tenfold by 2030, according to the US Department for Energy, so manufacturers are constantly building battery plants to keep up.</p>
    <p>Lithium mining <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67135047">can be controversial</a> as it can take several years to develop and has a considerable impact on the environment. Extracting the metal requires large amounts of water and energy, and the process can leave huge scars in the landscape, as well as toxic waste.</p>
    <p>Dr Nuria Tapia-Ruiz, who leads a team of battery researchers at the chemistry department at Imperial College London, said any material with reduced amounts of lithium and good energy storage capabilities is <i>"the holy grail"</i> in the lithium-ion battery industry.</p>
    <p><i>"AI and supercomputing will become crucial tools for battery researchers in the upcoming years to help predict new high-performing materials,"</i> she said.</p>
    <p>But Dr Edward Brightman, lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, said the tech would need to be <i>"treated with a bit of caution"</i>.</p>
    <p><i>"It could throw up spurious results, or results that look good at first, and then turn out to either be a material that is known or that can't be synthesized in the lab,"</i> he said.</p>
    <p>This AI-derived material, which at the moment is simply called N2116, is a solid-state electrolyte that has been tested by scientists who took it from a raw material to a working prototype.</p>
    <p>It has the potential to be a sustainable energy storage solution because solid-state batteries are safer than traditional liquid or gel-like lithium.</p>
    <p>In the near future, faster-charging solid-state lithium batteries promise to be even more energy-dense, with thousands of charge cycles.</p>

    <h2>How is this AI different?</h2>
    <p>The way in which this technology works is by using a new type of AI that Microsoft has created, trained on molecular data that can actually figure out chemistry.</p>
    <p><i>"This AI is all based on scientific materials, database, and properties,"</i> explained Mr. Zander.</p>
    <p><i>"The data is very trustworthy for using it for scientific discovery."</i></p>
    <p>After the software narrowed down the 18 candidates, battery experts at PNNL then looked at them and picked the final substance to work on in the lab.</p>
    <p>Karl Mueller from PNNL said the AI insights from Microsoft pointed them <i>"to potentially fruitful territory so much faster"</i> than under normal working conditions.</p>
    <p><i>"[We could] modify, test and tune the chemical composition of this new material and quickly evaluate its technical viability for a working battery, showing the promise of advanced AI to accelerate the innovation cycle,"</i> he said.</p>
